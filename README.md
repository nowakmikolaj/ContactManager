# Contact Manager

## About the project

Contact Manager is a simple application to easily store, add, modify and delete contact information, such as: names, email addresses, and phone numbers. There are two types of view available: list and grid. To create the application, I used WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), which provides a data binding mechanism.
